   BUNDLE BUDGETS.

   Code splitting is not a change you make once. It is a property that decays:
   one ordinary-looking import from a market module into a shared one pulls that
   market's whole graph back into the entry chunk, the site still works, every
   other test still passes, and the only visible symptom is that the first page
   view got slower. Nobody notices that in review.

   So the property is asserted. Three claims, in increasing order of strength:

     1. The entry chunk fits its budget. This is what a visitor downloads before
        anything renders, and it is the number that matters.
     2. Each split market has its own chunk, within its own budget.
     3. THE SPLIT IS REAL. Market-specific payloads must be absent from the entry
        chunk — not merely also present in a market chunk. A duplicated module
        satisfies (1) and (2) while shipping the bytes twice, and this is the
        assertion that catches it.

   MEASURED IN GZIP, because that is what crosses the network. Raw size is a
   diagnostic; it is not what the reader waits for. Both are reported on failure
   so a regression can be understood without a rebuild.

   Budgets are set a little above current so ordinary growth does not fail the
   build, and are meant to be RATCHETED DOWN as more markets are split. A budget
   that is never tightened stops being a budget. When one has to go up, that is a
   decision with a reason, and the reason belongs in the commit message.

   Skips without dist/, for the same reason and with the same escape hatch as
   the confidentiality guard: `npm test` must not require a build, and CI sets
   REQUIRE_OUTPUT=1 after building so the skip is unreachable there.
